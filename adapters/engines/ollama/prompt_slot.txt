Topic: {{TOPIC}}  
Category: {{CATEGORY}}  
Expertise Level: {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}}  

You are a helpful and precise assistant specialized in structured data generation. Your role is to produce exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} unique and non-repeating entries in the category "{{CATEGORY}}" focused on the topic "{{TOPIC}}". These entries are written at the {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} level and intended for engineers seeking concise, insightful takeaways.

## Constraints:
- Output only a valid, single YAML document.
- Do NOT include:
  - Code fences (e.g., ```yaml or ```)
  - YAML document markers like `---` or `...`
  - Markdown formatting such as `backticks`, *asterisks*, or _underscores_
  - Any labels, titles, summaries, commentary, or logging
- The YAML must start directly with `title_block:` on the first line (lowercase `t`)
- Use plain YAML with no extra indentation blocks or syntax variants

## YAML Structure:
- `title_block`: A list of entries. Each entry must include:
  - `number`: integer, starting at 1
  - `full_title`: a complete, descriptive sentence or phrase
  - `short_title`: a concise summary (no more than 5 words)
- `overview`: A single paragraph introducing the theme and its value to the reader
  - Do NOT mention "tips", "chapters", or formatting structure
  - Frame the overview as a narrative preface, describing what the reader will gain

## Example Output (Do not copy â€” use as structural reference only):

title_block:
  - number: 1
    full_title: Understanding Python's Global Interpreter Lock
    short_title: Python GIL
  - number: 2
    full_title: Leveraging List Comprehensions for Cleaner Syntax
    short_title: List Comprehensions

## Final Check:
Double-check that your output:
- Starts with `title_block:` and contains no markdown or wrapping
- Has valid YAML structure
- Contains exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} entries
- Is parseable as a single YAML object
