Topic: {{TOPIC}}  
Category: {{CATEGORY}}  
Expertise Level: {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}}  

You are an engineer with a {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} level of knowledge. {{CONTEXT_NOTE}}  
Your task is to generate exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} unique and non-repeating {{CATEGORY}}s related to the topic "{{TOPIC}}".

Requirements:
- Each entry must follow this exact format: FULL_TITLE | SHORT_TITLE
- FULL_TITLE must clearly describe a {{CATEGORY}} appropriate for the {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} level.
- SHORT_TITLE must be a concise summary or label (5 words max).
- Do not include any explanations, notes, or comments.
- The block must be enclosed with <TITLE_BLOCK_START> and </TITLE_BLOCK_END> — spelled exactly like this. Do not add extra characters, colons, or change casing.
- Avoid using phrases such as "additional", "continued", or "next set" — always generate a fresh, self-contained list.
- All tag lines (<TITLE_BLOCK_START>, </TITLE_BLOCK_START>, <TITLE_OVERVIEW>, </TITLE_OVERVIEW>) must appear unindented and start at the beginning of a new line with no preceding spaces or tabs.
- This must be a fresh, independent list.
- Do not continue from or refer to any prior entries.
- Never include transitional phrases such as “this continues”, “additionally”, or “following tips”.
- You must generate exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} entries inside the <TITLE_BLOCK_START> and </TITLE_BLOCK_END> block — no more and no less.
- You must generate only one <TITLE_BLOCK_START>...</TITLE_BLOCK_END> block. Never include multiple blocks.
- The total number of entries across the single block must exactly match {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}}.
- Never repeat <TITLE_BLOCK_START> or <TITLE_OVERVIEW> more than once.
- Generating more or fewer than {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} entries will be considered a failure of the task. You must count the lines inside <TITLE_BLOCK_START>...</TITLE_BLOCK_END> and stop when you reach {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}}.
- When {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} equals 1, you must generate only a single line inside the <TITLE_BLOCK_START> and </TITLE_BLOCK_END> block — do not interpret it as a request for a group or category. Any more than 1 line is incorrect.

Example:
<TITLE_BLOCK_START>
Understanding Variables in Python | Variables  
Using If Statements for Flow Control | Conditionals  
Looping with For and While | Loops  
Writing Your First Function | Functions  
Handling Input and Output | I/O Basics  
</TITLE_BLOCK_END>
<TITLE_OVERVIEW>
This collection introduces the topic {{TOPIC}}, highlights its relevance to the {{CATEGORY}} category, and is tailored for {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} learners.
</TITLE_OVERVIEW>
Validation Rules:
Before completing the response, confirm the following are true:
- The number of entries between <TITLE_BLOCK_START> and </TITLE_BLOCK_END> is exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}}.
- There is only one <TITLE_BLOCK_START> block and one <TITLE_OVERVIEW> block.
- No entries are duplicated.
- Each entry follows the FULL_TITLE | SHORT_TITLE format with a concise summary (≤ 5 words).
- No transitional language or references to prior output appear.
- All tag lines are flush-left with no indentation or extra characters.
If any of these conditions are not met, recheck your output and regenerate until all validations pass.
