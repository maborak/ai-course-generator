Topic: {{TOPIC}}  
Category: {{CATEGORY}}  
Expertise Level: {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}}  

You are an engineer with a {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} level of knowledge. {{CONTEXT_NOTE}}  
Your task is to generate exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} unique and non-repeating {{CATEGORY}}s related to the topic "{{TOPIC}}".

Requirements:
- Output must be a single valid JSON object — do not include markdown, code blocks, comments, or extra text before or after.
- Important: Output only the JSON object. Do not include logging, debug messages, markdown formatting, or explanatory commentary.
- The output must begin with `{` and end with `}` — nothing else outside the JSON.
- JSON must contain two keys:
  - "title_block": an array of objects, each with:
    - "number": index starting from 1
    - "full_title": a descriptive title for the item
    - "short_title": a concise summary (max 5 words)
  - "overview": a single paragraph written as the introduction to the complete eBook.
    - Do not refer to “tips,” “titles,” “entries,” “chapters,” or “sections.”
    - Write it as if you're introducing a full collection of categorized insights to the reader.
    - The tone should match the target expertise level and highlight the value of learning, applying, or mastering the {{TOPIC}}.
    - Emphasize the purpose, focus areas, and benefits of reading the content.

Output example:
{
  "title_block": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "full_title": "Misunderstanding Docker CMD vs ENTRYPOINT",
      "short_title": "CMD vs ENTRYPOINT"
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      "full_title": "Not Pinning Dependency Versions in Dockerfiles",
      "short_title": "Unpinned Dependencies"
    }
  ],
  "overview": "This collection is designed to help novice developers build a confident foundation in Docker usage. By exploring common pitfalls and practical insights, readers gain real-world awareness of configuration nuances, security considerations, and deployment strategies essential to modern container-based development."
