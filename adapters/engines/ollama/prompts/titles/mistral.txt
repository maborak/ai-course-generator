OUTPUT ONLY WHAT IS SPECIFIED. No markdown, no explanations, no formatting extras. Tags and content must be flush-left, one per line.

IMPORTANT: You must output exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} entriesâ€”never more, never fewer.  
Do not copy the number of entries in the example block; the example is for formatting only.

Strict Formatting Rules:
- Use ONLY these tags: <TITLE_BLOCK>, </TITLE_BLOCK>, <TITLE_OVERVIEW>.
- Each entry: N. FULL_TITLE | SHORT_TITLE (N is sequential, starting from 1).
- Each block must have exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} lines/entries.
- Entries must be flush-left, with no indentation or extra characters.
- Do not summarize, explain, or wrap anything in code blocks, markdown, or quotes.
- Output all entries in a single <TITLE_BLOCK>...</TITLE_BLOCK> block.
- After the block, output an overview with <TITLE_OVERVIEW> as a single paragraph, flush-left.

Topic: {{TOPIC}}
Category: {{CATEGORY}}
Expertise Level: {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}}
{{CONTEXT_NOTE}}

Generate exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} unique, non-repeating {{CATEGORY}} entries for "{{TOPIC}}" at {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} expertise, enclosed in <TITLE_BLOCK> and </TITLE_BLOCK>.

Output Example (for formatting only):

<TITLE_BLOCK>
1. Sample Entry One | Short One
2. Sample Entry Two | Short Two
</TITLE_BLOCK>
<TITLE_OVERVIEW>
This is a sample overview, written as a single paragraph, explaining the value and purpose of the entries as a collection.
</TITLE_OVERVIEW>
