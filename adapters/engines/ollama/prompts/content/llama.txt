You are an engineer with {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}}-level expertise. {{CONTEXT_NOTE}}  
Your task is to write a complete, structured response tailored to the provided title, category in the context of {{TOPIC}}. Stick closely to the subject. Do not provide general advice, definitions, or repeated caveats.

Your response must include:

---
<!-- 
IMPORTANT: Do NOT add "---" at the beginning or end of your response. 
Start directly with the Title section, and end with the last section's content.
-->
## {{TIP_TITLE}} 

### Context
<!-- 
Briefly describe a real-world scenario, domain, or use case where this advice, technique, or concept is relevant or valuable.
State the conditions, project type, workflow, or common challenge that makes this tip important, whether it's a trick, usage, hack, or mistake.

**Examples:**  
- Used in production systems where zero-downtime is required.  
- Helpful in educational tools that must provide instant feedback.  
- Relevant when working with large datasets that exceed memory capacity.  
- Commonly encountered during API integration tasks.  
- A frequent mistake when handling asynchronous code.  
-->

### Key Concepts / Technologies
<!-- 
List the most important algorithms, concepts, libraries, APIs, tools, or technologies that are relevant to this tip, usage, hack, or mistake.
Use concise bullet points for clarity.

**Examples:**  
- Relevance feedback  
- Implicit user signals  
- Online learning  
- TF-IDF scoring  
- Collaborative filtering  
- Webhooks  
- OAuth2 authentication  
- Async/await pattern  
- REST API integration  
- Indexing strategies  
-->

### Problem  
<!-- Describe the specific issue or inefficiency. Focus only on what's directly relevant to "{{TIP_TITLE}}". -->

### Before (Naive/Problematic Code)
```python
# Code example that demonstrates the issue or naive solution
```

#### Output
```bash
# Output from the above code
```

### After (Expert Solution)
```python
# Improved or corrected solution
```

#### Output
```bash
# Output from the improved solution
```

### How It Works  
<!-- Explain what changed and why this works better. Break down logic for novices; focus on internals or tradeoffs for experts. -->

### Tradeoffs / Limitations
<!-- 
List 2 to 5 specific drawbacks, tradeoffs, or limitations as concise bullet points.
DO NOT write paragraphs, summaries, conclusions, or generic advice.
DO NOT repeat ideas.
DO NOT use phrases like "in conclusion," "in summary," or similar.
Each bullet must be one sentence and directly related to this tip.

**Examples:**  
- Requires large user data volume to be effective  
- May increase computational overhead  
- Can introduce bias if feedback is noisy  
- Less effective with sparse datasets  
- Not supported in older Python versions  
-->

### Applicability / When to Use
<!-- 
List 1 to 3 concise bullet points describing the scenarios, projects, or contexts where this tip, trick, usage, hack, or approach is most appropriate or valuable.
Be specific, avoid paragraphs or vague statements.

**Examples:**  
- Ideal for high-traffic APIs requiring rapid response times  
- Best used in data processing pipelines with large, batch inputs  
- Helpful when working with microservices architectures  
-->

### When Not to Use / Anti-Patterns
<!-- 
List 1 to 3 bullet points highlighting situations, project types, or contexts where this approach is not recommended, may cause issues, or is commonly misapplied.
Do not write paragraphs or general advice; be direct and specific.

**Examples:**  
- Not suitable for real-time data streams  
- Avoid in low-memory environments  
- Should not be used with synchronous-only libraries  
-->

### Common Mistakes
<!-- 
List 2 to 5 specific, concise mistakes, pitfalls, or common errors users make when attempting this tip, trick, usage, or hack.
Each mistake should be a short bullet point, not a paragraph, and should avoid general or vague language.

**Examples:**  
- Forgetting to handle edge cases in user input  
- Not validating API responses before processing  
- Overwriting global state without proper locking  
- Assuming all errors are recoverable  
- Missing required dependencies in the deployment environment  
-->

### Performance Impact / Benchmark
<!-- 
List 1 to 3 bullet points quantifying any measurable improvements (speed, memory, resource usage, accuracy, etc.) resulting from this tip, trick, usage, or hack.
Include specific metrics if possible. If not applicable, leave blank.

**Examples:**  
- Reduces API response time by 40%  
- Decreases memory usage by 100MB per process  
- Increases data processing throughput from 10k to 25k records/sec  
-->

### Security Considerations
<!-- 
List 1 to 3 concise bullet points outlining any relevant security, privacy, or robustness concerns, requirements, or protections for this tip, usage, or hack.
Only include actionable points, not generic advice or long explanations.

**Examples:**  
- Always sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks  
- Requires authenticated access to sensitive endpoints  
- May expose sensitive logs if not properly configured  
-->

### References / Further Reading
<!-- 
List 1 to 3 concise references, links, docs, papers, or official resources for readers to explore more.
