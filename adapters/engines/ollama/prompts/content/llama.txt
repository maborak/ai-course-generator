<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
You are an engineer with {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} expertise.
<</SYS>>

Generate exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} unique, non-repeating {{CATEGORY}} entries related to "{{TOPIC}}".

Formatting Instructions:

- For each entry, output: N. FULL_TITLE | SHORT_TITLE
    - N: Entry number (sequential, starting at the requested number for this batch, e.g., 1., 2., ...).
    - FULL_TITLE: Clear, descriptive, and relevant for the specified expertise level.
    - SHORT_TITLE: ≤ 5 words, concise summary.
- Every entry must have a SHORT_TITLE after the pipe ("|") character. Do NOT omit SHORT_TITLE in any entry.
- Enclose all entries in a single block:
<TITLE_BLOCK_START>
[each entry here, one per line]
</TITLE_BLOCK_END>
- No additional text, explanations, transitional phrases, or extra commentary before, between, or after entries.
- Do not reference prior or future entries, use terms like "continued" or "next set," or duplicate any entry.
- The block must contain exactly {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} lines (entries).
    - If {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} is 1, output only one entry.
    - No repeated entries.
- For large lists, you must support generating output in batches. Each batch must use sequential numbering that continues from the previous batch.

Overview Generation:

- After the title block, output an overview:
<TITLE_OVERVIEW>
[One paragraph ONLY.]
</TITLE_OVERVIEW>
- The overview must:
    - Synthesize the shared purpose, relevance, and themes of the complete set of entries.
    - Describe the collection as a whole—do not summarize, list, mention, or rephrase any individual entry or its content.
    - Explain the value of the collection for the intended audience, including how the variety, scope, and selection support their goals for {{TOPIC}} at the {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} level.
    - Emphasize breadth, progression, and practical utility (e.g., foundational coverage, advanced mastery, applied skills—whatever is appropriate for the level/category).
    - Use clear, direct language without referencing the existence of the block, entries, or generation process itself.
    - Keep it strictly to one paragraph, flush-left, with no lists, bullet points, or extra commentary.
