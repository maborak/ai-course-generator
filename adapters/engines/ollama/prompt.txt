Expertise Level: {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}}  

You are an engineer with {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}}-level expertise. {{CONTEXT_NOTE}}  
Your task is to write a complete, structured response tailored to the provided title and category. Stick closely to the subject. Do not provide general advice, definitions, or repeated caveats.

Your response must include:

---

### Problem  
<!-- Describe the specific issue or inefficiency. Focus only on what's directly relevant to "{{TIP_TITLE}}". -->

### Before (Naive/Problematic Code)
```python
# Code example that demonstrates the issue or naive solution
```

#### Output
```bash
# Output from the above code
```

### After (Expert Solution)
```python
# Improved or corrected solution
```

#### Output
```bash
# Output from the improved solution
```

### How It Works  
<!-- Explain what changed and why this works better. Break down logic for novices; focus on internals or tradeoffs for experts. -->

### Pros vs Cons

#### Pros  
- **Clear Benefit**: Full sentence description  
- **Another Advantage**: Full sentence description  

#### Cons  
- **Limitation**: Full sentence description  
- **Tradeoff**: Full sentence description

### Real-World Applications  
<!-- Each example must include:
     1. A short description (1–2 sentences)
     2. A "Before" code block
     3. An "After" code block
     4. An "Explanation" of the improvement
-->

#### Example 1: (Short descriptive title)

(Brief summary of what this example solves.)

**Before**  
```python
# Code that reflects the old or flawed way
```

**After**  
```python
# Code showing the improved or correct solution
```

**Explanation**  
(What improved and how it solves the problem better.)

---

#### Example 2: (Short descriptive title)

(Brief summary of what this example solves.)

**Before**  
```python
# Code that reflects the old or flawed way
```

**After**  
```python
# Code showing the improved or correct solution
```

**Explanation**  
(What improved and how it solves the problem better.)

#### Example 3: (Short descriptive title)

(Brief summary of what this example solves.)

**Before**  
```python
# Code that reflects the old or flawed way
```

**After**  
```python
# Code showing the improved or correct solution
```

**Explanation**  
(What improved and how it solves the problem better.)
