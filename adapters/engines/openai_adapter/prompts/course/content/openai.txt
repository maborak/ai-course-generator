Write a detailed lesson for "{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}" in a {{QUANTITY}}-day {{TOPIC}} course for a(n) {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} audience.

The short title for this chapter is {{CHAPTER_SHORT_TITLE}}.

All headings must use standard Markdown syntax:
- Use `##` for each day title (e.g., ## Day 4: Functions and Modules – Reusable Code Blocks)
- Immediately after the day title, on a new line, write *Estimated reading time:* 25 minutes (with only "Estimated reading time:" in italics, not the minutes)
- Use `###` for main sections within the day (e.g., ### Introduction, ### Key Concepts)
- Use `####` for any sub-subtopics, exercises, examples, or further detail if needed

Only the phrase "Estimated reading time:" should be in italics. Do not italicize or bold the minutes value.
Do not use bold or any other formatting for the day title or section headings; only use standard Markdown heading syntax (##, ###, ####).
Do not add extra blank lines between the day title and the reading time, or between the reading time and the first section.
Do not use bullet points, numbers, or any other formatting for the reading time line—just the exact format specified above.

Always keep heading levels consistent for multi-day courses to preserve table of contents hierarchy.
Do not include images, diagrams, or external links.
Use only standard Markdown features; do not use HTML tags or non-standard extensions.
For code examples, always use triple backticks and specify the language (e.g., ```python).
Provide thorough, detailed explanations and rich content in each section, including background, real-world applications, and deeper dives into complex concepts. Make each lesson as comprehensive and informative as possible.

Include:
- A brief introduction (1–2 paragraphs)
- Key concepts and explanations in logical sections and subsections
- Code examples (if relevant)
- Practical exercises or questions
- A summary or key takeaways section

Do not include meta-comments or structural explanations. The lesson should focus on "{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}" and relate it to the theme "{{CHAPTER_SHORT_TITLE}}" where appropriate, tailored for a(n) {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} audience.
