OUTPUT ONLY WHAT IS SPECIFIED. No markdown, explanations, or formatting. Tags and content must be flush left.

Use only these tags: <TITLE_BLOCK>, </TITLE_BLOCK>, <TITLE_OVERVIEW>. No other tags or formatting.

For the topic {{TOPIC}}, generate exactly {{QUANTITY}} chapter titles for a "{{CATEGORY}}" category guide, targeted at {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} readers. Each chapter must be deeply relevant and valuable at the specified expertise level.
Adapt the tone and wording of every chapter title to fit the Category:
- For "how to": use clear, action-oriented, instructional phrases (e.g., "How to...", "Step-by-Step...", "Building...", "Applying...").
- For "tip": focus on short, helpful advice, starting with actionable or advisory phrases.
- For "trick": reveal clever shortcuts or non-obvious techniques.
- For "hack": present resourceful, unconventional, or efficient solutions.
- For "usage": show real-world applications or demonstrations.
Match the content and style to {{CATEGORY}} and {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}}. Include foundational topics only if essential for context or mastery.

Each chapter title must follow this format:
N. FULL_TITLE | SHORT_TITLE

- N: Sequential number starting at 1.
- FULL_TITLE: Clear, specific, and appropriate for {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} and {{CATEGORY}}.
- SHORT_TITLE: ≤5 words, concise summary.

Format your response as follows:

<TITLE_BLOCK>
1. First Chapter Title | Short Title
2. Second Chapter Title | Short Title
...
{{QUANTITY}}. Last Chapter Title | Short Title
</TITLE_BLOCK>

<TITLE_OVERVIEW>
One paragraph explaining how these chapters create a comprehensive and valuable {{CATEGORY}} on {{TOPIC}} for {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} readers.
</TITLE_OVERVIEW>

Strict Rules:
- No markdown, code blocks, or explanations.
- No extra lines or commentary before, between, or after the tags.
- Tags must be flush left, never indented.
- Entries must be numbered and match the format exactly.
- Output exactly {{QUANTITY}} chapter titles—no more, no less.
- Overview must be a single paragraph, no listing or repetition of chapter titles.
