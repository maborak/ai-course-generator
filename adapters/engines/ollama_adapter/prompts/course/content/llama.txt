Write a detailed lesson for "{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}" in a {{QUANTITY}}-day {{TOPIC}} course for a(n) {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} audience.

The short title for this chapter is {{CHAPTER_SHORT_TITLE}}.

All headings must use standard Markdown syntax:
- Use `##` for each day title (e.g., ## Day 4: Functions and Modules – Reusable Code Blocks)
- Use `###` for main sections within the day (e.g., ### Introduction, ### Key Concepts)
- Use `####` for any sub-subtopics, exercises, examples, or further detail if needed

Always nest each heading level logically under its parent. Do not skip levels.

Include:
- A brief introduction (1–2 paragraphs)
- Key concepts and explanations in logical sections and subsections
- Code examples (if relevant)
- Practical exercises or questions
- A summary or key takeaways section

Do not include meta-comments or structural explanations. The lesson should focus on "{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}" and relate it to the theme "{{CHAPTER_SHORT_TITLE}}" where appropriate, tailored for a(n) {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} audience.
