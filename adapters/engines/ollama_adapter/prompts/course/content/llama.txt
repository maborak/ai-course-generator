Write a detailed lesson for "{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}" in a {{QUANTITY}}-day {{TOPIC}} course for a(n) {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} audience.

The short title for this chapter is {{CHAPTER_SHORT_TITLE}}.

Structure the lesson using only Markdown headings. Use `##` for each main section (such as Introduction, Key Concepts, Summary), and `###` for any subsections under those main sections. Do not use a `###` heading unless it is directly under a `##` heading. Maintain a consistent and logical hierarchy—never skip levels.

Include:
- A brief introduction (1–2 paragraphs)
- Key concepts and explanations in logical sections and subsections
- Code examples (if relevant)
- Practical exercises or questions
- A summary or key takeaways section

The lesson should focus on "{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}" and relate it to the theme "{{CHAPTER_SHORT_TITLE}}" where appropriate, tailored for a(n) {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} audience. Do not include meta-comments or structural explanations.
