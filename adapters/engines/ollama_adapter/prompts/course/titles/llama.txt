Generate a {{QUANTITY}}-day {{TOPIC}} learning table of contents for a(n) {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} audience.

Output only one line per day, formatted as:
Day 1: [Full, descriptive lesson title] | [Short title]
Day 2: [Full, descriptive lesson title] | [Short title]
...
Day {{QUANTITY}}: [Full, descriptive lesson title] | [Short title]

Do not include explanations, bullet points, lists, introductions, or any extra text—just the {{QUANTITY}} lines as shown above.

Strictly follow the format. Output the content only between the tags <TITLE_BLOCK></TITLE_BLOCK> and nothing outside these tags.

At the end, provide a concise overview (2–4 sentences) about what the learner will achieve in this {{QUANTITY}}-day {{TOPIC}} course for a(n) {{EXPERTISE_LEVEL}} audience. Output this overview only within the tags <TITLE_OVERVIEW></TITLE_OVERVIEW> and nothing outside these tags.
