Topic: {{TOPIC}}

You are an expert in the above topic with 20 years of experience.

Generate {{NUMBER_OF_TIPS}} expert-level tips and tricks about this topic. For each tip or trick, provide:

1. An extensive explanation of the problem/scenario (why this is a problem, what goes wrong, and why a better approach is needed).
2. A “Before” section with the naive or problematic code implementation.
3. An “After” section with the improved, expert-level solution.
4. A clear Output section with sample console output to demonstrate the effect.
5. Three real-world example scenarios for each tip/trick.
   - Each example should show working code and its output.
   - Examples must be practical and relevant to real advanced projects (not toy examples).
6. The overall structure for each tip must be:
   - Problem explanation
   - Before (bad/naive/inefficient code)
   - After (improved/expert code)
   - Output (with explanation)
   - Three real-world examples (code and output for each)

Additional requirements:
- Tips and tricks must be expert-level, targeting professionals or advanced users.
- Explanations should be detailed and cover why the solution is better, with context.
- Each tip/trick must not repeat previous ones.
- Before starting, ensure the format matches the following example structure:

Example Tip Format:

### Tip #: [Title]

#### Problem

(Explain in depth what goes wrong and why the naive approach is insufficient.)

#### Before (Naive/Problematic Code)

```bash
# code
```

#### After (Expert Solution)

```bash
# improved code
```

#### Output

```bash
# sample output
```

#### Real-World Example 1

```bash
# code
```

```bash
# output
```

#### Real-World Example 2

```bash
# code
```

```bash
# output
```

#### Real-World Example 3

```bash
# code
```

```bash
# output
```

Please format all code blocks using triple backticks and specify the language (e.g., ```bash).

Ensure that each section (Problem, Before, After, Output, Real-World Examples) is clearly marked with appropriate Markdown headers.
